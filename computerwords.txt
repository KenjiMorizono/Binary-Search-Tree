computer is derived from a latin word computare which means to
calculate to count to sum up or to think together so more precisely
the word computer means a device that performs computation

computer
a person who computes

computer
a person who makes calculations especially with a calculating machine

computer 
an electronic device for storing and processing data typically in binary form
according to instructions given to it in a variable program

a computer is an electronic machine that can store and deal with large
amounts of information

computer
a device usually electronic that processes data according to a set of
instructions the digital computer stores data in discrete units and performs
arithmetical and logical operations at very high speed the analog
computer has no memory and is slower than the digital computer but has a
continuous rather than a discrete input the hybrid computer combines some of
the advantages of digital and analog computers

computer definition
an electronic device that stores and manipulates information unlike a
calculator it is able to store a program and retrieve information from its
memory most computers today are digital which means they perform operations
with quantities represented electronically as digits

a computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out arbitrary 
sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically the ability of
computers to follow generalized sets of operations called programs enables
them to perform an extremely wide range of tasks

computer
general purpose machine commonly consisting of digital circuitry that accepts
inputs stores manipulates and generates outputs data as numbers text graphics
voice video files or electrical signals in accordance with instructions called
a program

definition of computer
one that computes specifically a programmable usually electronic device that
can store retrieve and process data using a computer to design

computer a device used for computing specifically an electronic machine which
by means of stored instructions and information performs rapid often complex
calculations or compiles correlates and selects data now especially digital
computer

computer
an electronic device which is capable of receiving information data in a
particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with
a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions program to
produce a result in the form of information or signals

a computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data it
has the ability to store retrieve and process data

computer an electronic machine that is used for storing organizing and
finding words numbers and pictures for doing calculations and for
controlling other machines

a computer is an electronic machine that can solve different problems process
data store retrieve data and perform calculations faster and efficiently than
humans

a computer is a device that accepts information in the form of digitalized
data and manipulates it for some result based on a program or sequence of
instructions on how the data is to be processed complex computers also
include the means for storing data including the program which is also a form
of data for some necessary duration a program may be invariable and built
into the computer and called logic circuitry as it is on microprocessors
or different programs may be provided to the computer loaded into its storage
and then started by an administrator or user todays computers have both kinds
of programming

a computer is a programmable machine the two principal characteristics of a
computer are it responds to a specific set of instructions in a well defined
manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions a program

modern computers defined
modern computers are electronic and digital the actual machinery wires
transistors and circuits is called hardware the instructions and data are
called software

technically a computer is a programmable machine this means it can execute a
programmed list of instructions and respond to new instructions that it is
given today however the term is most often used to refer to the desktop and
laptop computers that most people use when referring to a desktop model the
term computer technically only refers to the computer itself not the monitor
keyboard and mouse still it is acceptable to refer to everything together
as the computer some of the major parts of a personal computer or pc include
the motherboard cpu memory or ram hard drive and video card while personal
computers are by far the most common type of computers today there are
several other types of computers

a computer is programmed device with a set of instructions to perform
specific tasks and generate results at a very high speed

computer science is the study of the theory experimentation and engineering
that form the basis for the design and use of computers it is the scientific

although its name contains the word science computer science is usually
considered to be a branch of engineering this is in sharp contrast to most
of the physical sciences which separate the understanding and advancement of
the science from its practical applications science is a technique for
learning about the natural world by applying the principles of the scientific
method which includes making empirical observations proposing hypotheses
to explain those observations and then testing those hypotheses engineering
is the application of science

computers are virtually indispensable to the field of computer science yet
as edsger dijkstra a pioneering computer scientist so aptly put it computer
science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes

computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice it requires
thinking both in abstract terms and in concrete terms the practical side of
computing can be seen everywhere getting computers to do what you want them
to do requires intensive hands on experience but computer science can be
seen on a higher level as a science of problem solving computer scientists 
must be adept at modeling and analyzing problems they must also be able to
design solutions and verify that they are correct problem solving requires
precision creativity and careful reasoning computer science also has strong
connections to other disciplines many problems in science engineering health
care business and other areas can be solved effectively with computers but
finding a solution requires both computer science expertise and knowledge of
